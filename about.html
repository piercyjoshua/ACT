      <h1>About the Game</h1>
  <p><i>A Confectionery Tale</i> is a multimedia roguelike project. It is, first and foremost, a tabletop role playing game which is heavily influenced by both classic RPGs, such as Dungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder, as well as roguelike video games such as DCSS, Brogue, and ADOM. It is for 1-4 players, plus a Dungeon Master.
<br><br>
In the game, players will choose from one of 25 classes, each with their own unique strengths, weaknesses, and playstyles. Players will build their character as they see fit, leveling up and changing their gear throughout campaigns.
<br><br>
The game is meant to be played by both hardcore role playing fans and casual boardgame fans alike; while characters will progress across game sessions, anyone can jump in at any point and be useful to a team, even at level one. The game is designed around this, with leveling up being focused around opening up new options for the players as opposed to increasing their stats.
<br><br>
Each game session opens with the players entering a town. Here they can shop, find quests, level up, upgrade gear, and roleplay. 
<br><br>
Following the town phase, players enter a dungeon of their choice. Dungeons are built by the players on the fly as “dungeon tiles” are randomly drawn and placed around the board. Each time the players enter a new tile, an “encounter card” is drawn, determining what will happen in that room; encounters include entering combat, facing traps, or acquiring loot. 
<br><br>
In combat, players move from the “dungeon board” to the “combat board”- a smaller, 20x20 square grid on which combat takes place. Combat is relatively simple, meant to be played by casual and expert fans alike, but allows for numerous tactics. Many skills are based around manipulating the environment.
<br><br>
At the end of a dungeon, whose length is determined by its preselected difficultly, players face a boss. Following this, they will acquire loot by drawing cards from the “loot deck”. 
<br><br>
If players die within a dungeon, they are revived at the entrance to the next floor. If the entire party wipes, they are ejected from the dungeon, losing all items they found; experience, however, is retained.
<br><br>
More systems are found within the game than the ones described here; advanced classes, cross-classes, weapon upgrading and enchanting, status effects, relic gear, and mercenaries will all be described in future posts.
